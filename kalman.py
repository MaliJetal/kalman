"""
A gross oversimplification of the the kalman filter
For each timestep:
current estimation = Gain * Measured + (1 - Gain) * previousestimation

The only unknown is the gain, this is continually revised using new
info and something from the previous state Kalman filter finds the
most optimum averaging factor for each consequent state. Also somehow
remembers a little bit about the past states
a very good dummy intro:
